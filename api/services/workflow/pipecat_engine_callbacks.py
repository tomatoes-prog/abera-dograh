"""Callback factory helpers for :pyclass:`~api.services.workflow.pipecat_engine.PipecatEngine`.

Each helper takes a :class:`PipecatEngine` instance and returns an async
callback function suitable for passing to the various pipeline processors.
Separating these helpers into their own module keeps
``pipecat_engine.py`` focused on high-level engine orchestration logic while
encapsulating the callback implementations here for easier maintenance and
unit-testing.
