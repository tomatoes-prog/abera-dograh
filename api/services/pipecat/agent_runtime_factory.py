"""Building an :class:`AgentRuntime` for one visit to one workflow.

Call setup creates the first runtime and attaches its child worker here.
Transfers build later runtimes under the hold ringer, using the destination's
pinned definition and model configuration. Both use the same generation stage.

Everything call-scoped -- transport, recording, recognition, the shared
context, the call timer -- stays on the call pipeline and is never rebuilt.
What this creates is one agent's own LLM and TTS clients and the child worker
that runs them.
